Coursework on Strategic Brand Management with strong emphasis on experimentation and hypothesis testing

## Background
As part of a school course, I created a blog brand, Football Manager Hero, that teaches players of a soccer simulation video game (Football Manager, herein FM) how to effectively manage lower-league teams.

To grow the brand, I proposed, executed and evaluated growth hacks (aka experiments), leveraging my solid educational background on experimental design and hypothesis testing. This process involved (1) generating a hypotheses (null & alternative), (2) designing an experiment to collect data and test the hypothesis (3) selecting metrics that are aligned with the hypothesis (4) selecting an appropriate statistical test given the data and (5) verifying or refuting the hypothesis

The growth hacks I ran are described below as well their results and key insights from the tests:
